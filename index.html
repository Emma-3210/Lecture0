        <h1>An adventurous story!</h1>

       <p>Today I am going to tell you about a topic dear to me, namely about my cats, when I was 6-7 years old I lived in the city, but in the summer, when the summer holidays came, I wanted to go to the village, I really liked it there, fresh air, I could exploit all nature, it was beautiful, I had a house there, my mother noticed that 
I liked cats and every summer I insisted on buying my cat. Eventually he gave in and bought my cat. I was jumping up for happiness because finally my dream had come true. So I named the cat Sagua and it was my favorite, it was white with yellow spots, a wonderful cat!She was a very playful cat, silky, she loved to be caressed and combed. I learned so many things: to open the door, to roll, to follow me, to be a brave cat.
