<p>When he was still a little chick, he always found himself clinging to something and playing around with me. He was one of the most playful cats I've had over the years. One day we had to leave home in visit someone, and because it was just a baby I left her in the house, leaving her food and everything she needed. I closed the door and I leave in peace beacause know she had everything she needed in the house. When I left her at home, she happily ate her favorite food.I visited with my sister and my parents some close relatives, and not long after I came home.When I got home and opened the door of the room, I was desperately trying to find my cat. I searched everywhere .... but Sagua seemed to have entered the ground. It was nowhere, I was wondering if someone came when I was gone and I was scared, I was desperately trying to find her. Not long after I started to hear a noise, because I left a small door open that led to the chimney
or on the chimney in the other room,
she thought in her research to take advantage of this opportunity and climbed the chimney. </p>
